Guess the Number Game
This is a Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100, and asks the user to guess the number. The program provides feedback to the user on whether their guess was too high or too low, and keeps track of the number of guesses it took the user to find the correct answer. Additionally, the program includes a timer, sound effects, and the ability to save and display high scores.

Requirements
To run this program, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer.
